# ASD HUST

This repo is the official implementation of "Artificial intelligence-enabled ECG detection of atrial septal defect among adults: A novel diagnostic tool". 

This including the whole train code of our proposed transformed based model. 

This ECG datasets collected for this study will be available after approval by the corresponding author.

## Introduction

We developed an AI-ECG algorithm to detect ASD in adults using a CNN with a residual network. Our study innovatively utilized AI-enabled 8-lead ECG classification, achieving accurate screening for congenital heart disease with comprehensive data and dual-center validation.
